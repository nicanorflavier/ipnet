## Why IPnet? A Comparison with ipcalc

You might be thinking, "Why should I use IPnet when I already have ipcalc?" Well, let's talk about that.

First off, ipcalc is a fantastic tool, no doubt about it. It's available in most distributions and provides a wealth of information. But it's written in Perl. Now, there's nothing wrong with Perl, but if you're working in a Python-centric environment or you're a Python developer, IPnet will feel more at home in your workflow. It's written in Python, which means you can easily extend it, modify it, or integrate it into your Python projects. 

Secondly, ipcalc does provide a lot of information, including binary representations by default. But sometimes, you just need the basics. You need to get in, get the info, and get out. That's where IPnet shines. It focuses on providing the essential network information in a simple, easy-to-understand format. No frills, no unnecessary complexity, just the network info you need when you need it.

So, if you're looking for a tool that's Python-based, simple, and straightforward for quick network information, give IPnet a try.
